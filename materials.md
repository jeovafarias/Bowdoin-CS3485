## Book

[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) by Zhang, Aston, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola: a **great** online book that covers most of the content of our course (with code) and also provides the preliminary background for Deep Learning. It also has a free [pdf version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11342) and you can also buy a hard copy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dive-into-Learning-Aston-Zhang/dp/1009389432).

## Math and ML Background
* Stanford's preliminary docs in [Linear Algebra](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2024-extra/modules/prerequisites/linear-algebra.pdf) and [Calculus](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2024-extra/modules/prerequisites/vector-calculus.pdf).
* [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/): Great resource for anything ML, including a page on [Linear Algebra for ML](https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-algebra-machine-learning/).
* [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](http://ema.cri-info.cm/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019BurkovTheHundred-pageMachineLearning.pdf): Great crash course in ML (the title says it all).

## Additional Course Materials

* [Latex Tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes): you'll need Latex for most of the assigments! I suggets you use [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com) and an latex template from a sceintific journal (like [this one](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-small-standard-format-template/sksvmbxyfhnw)).
* [Pytorch Tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/pytorch-tutorial-develop-deep-learning-models/): In case you need another resource.
